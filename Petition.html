                        The image you see on the right is a representation of our professor every morning, right before his much-needed 
                        coffee that helps thaw him out a bit. Imagine having to wake up at 4 or 5 AM in the dead of winter just to prepare 
                        for class. Technically, since the sun hasnâ€™t even risen yet, can we really call 4 AM "morning"? The frigid cold, 
                        combined with the mental fog of early hours, is an unfair battle both for students and faculty alike. No one should 
                        have to endure sub-zero temperatures just to attend an 8 AM lecture. Morning brain freeze inevitably leads to null 
                        pointer exceptions in our heads! For these reasons, we humbly request the administration to consider shifting 
                        CPTS 489 to a more humane afternoon time slot.
